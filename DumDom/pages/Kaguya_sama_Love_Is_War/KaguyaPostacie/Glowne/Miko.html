                <h2>Origin</h2>

                <p>
                    Miko was based off on Ishidzukuri no Miko (石作 皇子), the first suitor from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter">The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</a>, who had been tasked with collecting the Stone Begging Bowl of the Buddha. Her fascination with sutras and poetry is likely based on her counterpart being a poet and his attempts to woo Princess Kaguya with poetry after failing his task.
                </p>
                
            </div>

            <div id="Wyglad">
                <h2>Apperance</h2>

                <p>
                    Miko is a short, petite young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair that is styled in loose pigtails, with bangs covering her forehead. When in Shuchi'in Academy high school uniform, she wears black tights and a yellow armband on her left arm to distinguish herself as a member of the Public Morals Committee.                
                </p>

            </div>

            <div id="Osobowosc">
                <h2>Personality</h2>

                <p>
                    Miko is most notable for her strong and obstinate sense of justice and decency. She is convinced that the morality of Shuchi'in Academy has been declining, and thus wishes to impose heavy, though unreasonable, regulations on students. Because of her overbearing and borderline authoritarian attitude, she was generally disliked by the student body. Despite this, Miko’s determination never wavered, as she continued to confront those who she deemed were acting unfairly, even at the expense of her own reputation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Like <a href="Shirogane.html">Miyuki</a>, she holds herself at a high standard, being at the top of her class and even running for President of the 68th Student Council despite being a freshman. Though she rarely shows it, Miko seeks the validation of her peers and wants them to understand her ideas. She seems to have crippling stage fright.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite her no-nonsense attitude, Miko has her fair share of eccentricities. She has a voracious appetite in spite of her size, which she is embarrassed by. She also overuses emoticons when texting in contrast to her more professional demeanor. Ironically, while she is vehemently against anything lewd or perverted, Miko’s mind is actually quite suggestive and she has a tendency to misinterpret normal situations into being sexual. 
                    <br><br>
                    Miko can be quite naive at times, having an unrealistic perception of love and believing that her ideal boyfriend will be a prince. She is incredibly easy to manipulate, as simply complimenting her or giving her praise is enough to calm her down and treat the one who complimented or praised her nicely.
                    <br><br>
                    When Miko dropped the good girl act to for a short while in order to pursue a relationship, she is shown to be capable of manipulating people with ease as well as being a natural liar.
    
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="Historia">
                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>
                    Miko's father is a judge in the Supreme Court and her mother works in an international humanitarian support group. Their vocations led to a lonely childhood for Miko. This set off her thought that "My mom and dad are busy because there's so many bad people". Due to this, she developed a strong personality that follows moral correctness; always being the first to come to school, doing the teacher's directive, and always at the top of her grade when it comes to scores. She adores justice and wants to set everything around her straight, even at the cost of her reputation. Her infamy for being obsessive in correction lead to her continuously losing during multiple Student Council elections.
                    <br><br>
                    Miko became a member of the Public Morals Committee in middle school and she was the best at her job. She told off anyone who was disobeying school regulations, popular students, scary upperclassmen, which led to piercing gazes and haunting grudges from them. Her idea of justice is stifling to most of the people she encounters. Yet, despite all those speaking negatively of her, she never shed a tear in public. She described this point as the hardest time of her life. During this time, she received a letter and a pressed flower (which she still preserves to this day) from an anonymous person. Her ideal of pure love stems from this incident.
                    <br><br>
                    After her loss in an election to <a href="Shirogane.html">Miyuki</a>, Miko was grateful to him for helping her present her speech while being frustrated at the fact that she lost at the same time. <a href="Shirogane.html">Miyuki</a> invited her to join the 68th Student Council as the Auditor while continuing to participate in the Public Morals Committee. Miko, though elated, declared that she needed some time to decide. The next day, she officially became a member of the 68th Student Council. After joining, Miko frequently butted heads with Yu, and witnessed several awkward moments between <a href="Kaguya.html">Kaguya</a> and <a href="Shirogane.html">Miyuki</a>, having walked in on the two in compromising positions at the worst possible time; which lead her to think that the 68th Student Council's leaders were immoral.
                    <br><br>
                    The hostility between Miko and <a href="Ishigami.html">Yu</a> continued until the school's Culture Festival. As Miko was the student most in favor of having a large bonfire, she decided to miss the festival and patrol the surrounding area in order to comply with fire safety regulations. <a href="Ishigami.html">Yu</a>, noting Miko's absence, went to find her, and presented her with a heart-shaped pendant (possibly the one that <a href="Kaguya.html">Kaguya</a> lost), citing school regulations which state that any objects found on school grounds should be returned to the discipline committee. <a href="Ishigami.html">Yu</a> then showed Miko pictures of the other students enjoying themselves at the festival, in an effort to cheer her up. It is hinted that Miko's feelings towards <a href="Ishigami.html">Yu</a> change at this point, at least internally. In later chapters, she is implied to have a crush towards <a href="Ishigami.html">Ishigami</a>.
